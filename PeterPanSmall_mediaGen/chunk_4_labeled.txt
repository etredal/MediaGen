        The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her, <sfx name="Crowd Murmuring"/> and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, <sfx name="Horse Carriage"/> who took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her, except the innermost box and the kiss. He never knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it, <sfx name="Sword Clash"/> but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door. <sfx name="Door Slam"/>
