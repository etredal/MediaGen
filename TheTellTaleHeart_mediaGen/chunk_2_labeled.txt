        "True! — nervous — very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? <sfx name="Heartbeat"/> The disease had sharpened my senses — not destroyed — not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. <sfx name="Whispers"/> I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. <sfx name="Distant Scream"/> How, then, am I mad? <sfx name="Maniacal Laugh"/> Hearken! and observe how healthily — how calmly I can tell you the whole story."
