Without, <sfx name="Wind Howling"/>the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlor of Laburnam Villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly.

"That's the worst of living so far out," bawled Mr. White, with sudden and unlooked-for violence; "Of all the beastly, slushy, out-of-the-way places to live in, this is the worst.
