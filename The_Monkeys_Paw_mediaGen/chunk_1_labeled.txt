Without, <sfx name="Wind Howling"/> the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlor of Lakesnam Villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly.

<voice name="Mrs. White"> 
"It sounds as if someone is crying in the wind."

"I expect he's dead," said his father gruffly. "He would be if he had any sense."
